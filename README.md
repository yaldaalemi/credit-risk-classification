The accuracy of the model is 0.99 which means that the model is correct 99% of the time but it is not a good indicator to evaluate the model with since in this case for example, the healthy loans outweight the high-risk loans. It is better to evaluate the model by the other indicators shown in the classificatino report. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations which means that out of all the loans classified as healthy loans 100% of them are healthy loans but out of the loans classified as high-risk loans only 87% are actually high-risk loans and 13% are false positives. Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all predicted observations for that class. This means that out of all the healthy loans 100% of them were classified correctly as healthy loans but out of all the hight-risk loans, 89% of them were calssified correctly as high-risk loans. F1-score takes into account both the precision and the recall and we can conclude that overall the model is much better at predicting the healthy loans compared to high-risk loans.
